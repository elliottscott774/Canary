    "# Canary\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook is intended to explain the process of how to create the card game named 'Canary'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Setup\n",
    "- The game can accommodate 2-8 players.\n",
    "- For 2-4 players, a single deck with 54 cards (including 2 Jokers) is used. For 5-8 players, two decks (108 cards total) are used.\n",
    "- At the start, each player is dealt 3 face-down cards, which are to remain facedown, and an additional 6 cards. From the additional 6 cards, they choose 3 to place face-up for everyone to see. The remaining 3 cards remain in their hand.\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "- The goal of the game is to be the first player to play all of your cards (First from hand, then from face-up, and lastly the face-down).\n",
    "#### Game Play\n",
    "- The game begins by determining the starting player, which is based on who has the lowest card, starting from 3s and moving upward as needed. Ties are determined by who has the most of the worst card.\n",
    "- Players take turns in a clockwise order.\n",
    "- On their turn, a player must play a card that beats the card played before it.\n",
    "- If a player cannot play a card, or does not wish to play a card, they must pick up the cards in the played pile. \n",
    "- Players can play multiple cards of the same value at the same time.\n",
    "- If a player has less than 3 cards in their hand and the draw pile isn't empty, they must draw until they have 3 cards.\n",
    "- Once a player has no cards in their hand, and the draw pile is empty, they can start playing their face-up cards. Once no cards remain in their hand or faceup pile, they must choose a face-down card to turn over. If the card beats the previous card, they may play it. If it does not, they must pick up the pile and the card they just turned over.\n",
    "#### Special Cards and Rules\n",
    "- 2: Can be played on any card. Allows the player to take another turn.\n",
    "- 7: The next card played must be 7 or lower. 7s must be played in numerical order.\n",
    "- 10: Can be played on any card. Clears the pile of cards played before it.\n",
    "- Ace: The highest value card.\n",
    "- Joker: Can be played on any card. Reverses the order of play.\n",
    "- If the same value card is played 4 times in a row, the pile is cleared.\n",
    "#### Winning the Game\n",
    "- The first player to play all of their cards (hand, face-up, and face-down) is declared the winner and is called the \"Canary\".\n",
