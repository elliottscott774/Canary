    "The purpose of this notebook is to experiment with various CPU players of the game of canary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In canary_notebook.ipynb, the players make random choices. For example, the act of choosing 3 face up cards is done randomly. Another example is every time a player chooses what card to play, they choose randomly from the legal plays in their hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy I will implement is the 'play low' strategy. In this strategy, the player will always attempt to play their lowest valued playable card. For example, suppose the top card is a 4 and the current player has a 3, 4, and 5. Using the 'play low' strategy the CPU will choose to play the 4 since it is the lowest valued playable card. Special cards will be treated as the most valuable cards, with the 2 being the highest value card, since having the ability to play again allows for certain face up strategies. The 10 is the next most valuable with its ability to clear potentially large pick ups that would destroy all hopes of winning. The Joker is strong in end game situations where coordinated play between players can result in a leading player not being able to play their last card(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions about card values are purely based on my experience playing many games with my friends."
